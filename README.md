# Prodigy_CS_01
In this task, I worked on a program that implements the Caesar cipher encryption and decryption algorithm in C++. The program allows users to encrypt or decrypt text using a specified key. It maintains the original case of alphabetic characters and leaves non-alphabetic characters unchanged.
Here's a brief overview of what the program accomplishes:

It prompts the user to choose between encryption and decryption.
Users input the text they want to encrypt/decrypt and the key for the operation.
The program then performs the encryption/decryption operation based on the user's input and displays the result.
Users have the option to continue encrypting/decrypting more text or exit the program.
Throughout this task, I enhanced my understanding of C++ programming and gained hands-on experience with string manipulation and conditional statements. It was an enriching learning experience, and I'm excited to tackle more challenges and contribute further to Prodigy InfoTech's projects.
